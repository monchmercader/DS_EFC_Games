From the sampleswap.org website:

Are these sounds royalty-free? Can I use them in a commercial arrangement?

In two words: Not necessarily. Our policy is to require that contributors only upload original sounds that they are giving up into the public domain, but there's no way for us to be sure that 100% of the sounds on this site are free and clear from any copyright restrictions. You'll have to use your own judgement.
