# Bare Conductive Pi Cap Simple MQTT Utility

This code example isn't supported anymore. This utility required python-mosquitto, which isn't included in the latest Raspbian release. You can still use our [Pi Cap C++ MQTT Utility](https://github.com/BareConductive/picap-simple-mqtt-cpp) or our [Pi Cap Node MQTT Utility](https://github.com/BareConductive/picap-simple-mqtt-js).
