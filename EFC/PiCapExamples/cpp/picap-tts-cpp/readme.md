# Bare Conductive Pi Cap Text To Speech Utility

Example text-input speech synthesis code for the [Bare Conductive Pi Cap](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/pi-cap/). You need twelve plain text files named TEXT000.txt to TEXT011.txt in a folder called `texts` inside this folder. When you touch electrode E0, TEXT000.txt will be read out to you. When you touch electrode E1, TEXT001.txt will be read, and so on. Playback is not polyphonic (espeak can't handle it).
